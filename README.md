# Interactive-Probability-Distribution-with-variable-parameters
This contains various discrete and continuous probability distributions. This is a group project done with my colleagues.  If it does not work, then try to use it on "HuggingFace" portal. 
    
You have to simply copy paste the code in any envorinment having the mentioned libraries. Then play with parameters to see the graphs vary.
